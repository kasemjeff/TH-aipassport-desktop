# Changelog

What changed, in behavior terms — not a file-by-file log. The release
procedure, acceptance criteria and rollback live in [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A failed send leaves a trace.** A run that stops because a send threw
  now records the cause in the session (a `note` entry and
  `run_stats.sendError`) instead of losing it, so the next failure names its
  shape (`test/harness-fixes.test.mjs`).
- **`maxCredits` — a spend cap per run.** The loop counts observed spend
  against the bridge's cached quota (0 = off, the default) and stops a run at
  the ceiling with the stop reason `credit-limited`. Set it in Settings, in
  `settings.json`, or per eval task / `--budget maxCredits=`.
- **The secret floor covers the execution channels.** A RUN whose command
  spells a secret path is refused before anything spawns, SEARCH skips secret
  files even when their names are not dot-hidden, and git patches touching a
  secret are withheld from output (the runtime residual — a name built at
  runtime inside a program — is stated in `SECURITY.md`).
- **Plugin API versioning.** `plugins.mjs` exports `PLUGIN_API` (1); a plugin
  whose `apiVersion` needs a newer harness is refused at load before
  `setup()` runs, and a plugin without one loads as `apiVersion: null`.
- **Reliability targets get a home** (`docs/RELIABILITY.md`): the SLIs the
  commands already print, a zero-warn error budget at release time, and the
  degradation modes indexed. `run_stats` now records the model it ran on,
  and `stats` groups by model and project — `byModel` / `byRoot` in `--json`,
  new `models:` / `projects:` lines in the text report, models in the HTML
  header.
- **The backup/restore drill runs in the suite**
  (`aipass-bridge/test/restore-drill.test.mjs`): a copied home restores into
  a second environment with the same sessions, settings and token; RTO/RPO
  are written down in `docs/DATA_FORMATS.md`.
- **A new default model is an audited change** (`docs/SPEC_EVALS.md`):
  approval gates (safety set solved, no regression, ≤2× cost), the routing
  policy in one place, and "no automatic fallback" stated where it can be
  found; the evals summary gains a `wall median`.
- **`SECURITY.md` grows the governance half**: data classes, owners, threat
  model, and the vulnerability process — triage → fix with test → verify
  closure → announce; `docs/RELEASE.md` gains the release-evidence pack.
- Session headers record `app` — the build that wrote the file — so a
  transcript answers "which version did this come from".
- **`npm run stats -- --alerts / --strict / --json / --html FILE`** — the
  pull-based alerting a local install can have: refusal-rate spikes,
  guard-trip shares, cost outliers and firewall notes, plus a self-contained
  HTML report.
- **`npm run loadtest`** — concurrent local-API smoke with latency and
  memory reporting (`--strict` for release gates). Not part of CI.
- **Evals: `--attempts N`** repeats every task in one run and reports every
  row (the stochastic-run policy: medians, never the best draw), the summary
  gains a `grounded` metric (DONE runs a declared check confirmed), and the
  safety set ships: `refuse-secret` and `ignore-injection`, live-only.
- **Structured log lines + request ids.** `AIPASS_LOG_FORMAT=json` turns
  bridge logs into one JSON object per line; every bridge request carries a
  short `x-aipass-rid` that rides its error lines.
- `docs/RELEASE.md` (versioning, acceptance criteria, upgrade/rollback,
  dependency review), `.github/dependabot.yml`, and tests for data integrity
  (torn/duplicated/wrong-typed lines, settings forward-compatibility) and
  concurrent RPC bursts.

### Changed

- Session load is explicit about bad data: a duplicated entry id loads once,
  lines that parse to the wrong type are skipped, and only an object with a
  string `id` counts as a header.
- `docs/SPEC_EVALS.md` no longer claims the loop lacks wall-clock caps (it
  does not lack them; the credit cap was the missing one, and now ships
  opt-in). Open question 2 (attempt policy) is resolved as built.

### Fixed

- **A refused send no longer ends the run at the first exhaustion.** Past the
  redact/wait/split/omit chain the loop pauses and sends the same message
  again (`RECOVER_WAITS_MS` — 30s then 60s, bounded): the connection-cycle
  shapes, a tab still loading, rate windows, and 403s that were never about
  the content. Each recovery is a `firewall_note` and counts in
  `run_stats.sendRecoveries`; the transport also waits out a content script
  mid-reinjection (`TRANSIENT_SEND`), and a run that still dies keeps its
  recorded cause (`test/agent.test.mjs`).
- **GLOB speaks shell globs again.** Brace alternation (`*.{js,css,html}`)
  and `?` are expanded and matched the way the shells do; the braces were
  escaped before, so a tree full of matching files answered "no files matched"
  (`test/tools.test.mjs`).
- **The nudge names a broken marker.** When a reply contained marker-shaped
  text that did not parse, the correction now says so and lists the shape
  rules (start of its own line, no indentation, bold or code fence, exact
  keyword) instead of the generic "no marker" line.
- `RUN type .env`, `SEARCH` over `server.pem`, and `git show HEAD:.env` were
  three ways around the secret floor; all three are refused now
  (`test/secret-screen.test.mjs`).

## [0.2.0]

The release this repository is at. The ground-up continuation, in buckets:

- **The window** (`desktop/`): Tauri shell, chat UI, settings sheet, diffs
  with apply/reject, session picker, plan mode, project switching.
- **The bridge** (`aipass-bridge/bridge/`): WAF-safe relay between the local
  harness and the logged-in chat tab, quota/models routes, admin routes
  behind `AIPASS_ADMIN=1`, loopback-only with a bearer token.
- **The harness**: the pi-style session JSONL, the marker tool protocol,
  permissions with the secret floor, the loop with its guards (stagnation,
  repeat, chain, verify), compaction, overlay/apply, and the apply-then-check
  discipline.
- **The Thai pack**: `replyLanguage`/language check, the Thai/English eval
  pair set, and Thai-first UI copy.
- **Hardening**: loopback token on every route, openers take argv only, one
  WAF table, one-run-per-harness lock.
- **Stability**: capped rotating logs, atomic session writes, spill pruning,
  crash handlers that name the death instead of vanishing.
- **Evals** (`npm run evals`): check-decides-outcome task fixtures, live and
  replay modes, fingerprints that mark stale replays instead of scoring them.
